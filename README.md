1. Total Combinations:
         
This code snippet calculates the total number of combinations possible when rolling two six-sided dice (Die A and Die B). It uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible outcomes of the two dice rolls.

2.Distribution of Combinations:

This part creates a 6x6 matrix representing all possible combinations when rolling Die A and Die B together. Each cell (i, j) in the matrix corresponds to the sum obtained by rolling Die A with face i and Die B with face j.

3.Probability of Sum Calulation:

This code calculates the total number of combinations and then determines the distribution of sums when rolling two six-sided dice (Die A and Die B). It uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible outcomes and maintains a dictionary (Sum) to count the occurrences of each sum and another part calculates and prints the probability of each sum occurring based on the counts stored in the Sum dictionary.
